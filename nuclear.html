			<h1>Nuclear</h1>
			
			<p>Nuclear disaster is arguably the most dangerous and likely to happen between all the disasters presented in this website. Nuclear bombs have both multiplied in quantity and increased in power over time. It would now take a nuclear bomb the size of a water bottle to blow up a city. It would take 10 nuclear bombs to destroy the world and all life entirely. There are currently 15,000 nuclear sources on this planet, all controlled by 9 different countries.</p>

			<p>The history of Soviet-US nuclear deterrence is full of close calls and dangerous mistakes. Numerous times have generals panicked over unidentified data missiles and almost retaliated with nuclear attacks. How many close-calls until someone actually orders a retaliatory launch?</p>

			<p>If the explosions themselves aren't bad enough, the fallout would kill everybody locally and leave the area uninhabitable for generations, if not centuries. Additionally, there is the threat of nuclear winter - soot blasted into the stratosphere causing a multi-year cooling and drying of the world, leaving billions to starve and suffer from disease.</p>

			<p>But remember, we don't have to wait until someone drops a bomb somewhere to feel the effects of nuclear radiation. Nuclear waste from worldwide power plants and meltdowns are already a reality. The remains of these nuclear cores are being buried unground because we don't know what to do with them once they've been used up. In some cases, such as the current Fukushima crisis, nuclear radiation is poisoning the world at an uncontrollable rate. These collections of nuclear waste will be destroying their surrounding environments for centuries to come.</p>
