			<h1>Global Warming</h1>
			
			<p>Despite what the climate change deniers would have you believe, climate change is real. It is being caused by human beings, with help from a lot of farting cows emitting methane and a giant well of methane being released from under the melting Arctic ice. Every day, more and more greenhouse gases are building up in the atmosphere, resulting in a slowly rising average Earth temperature, despite the occasional freezing cold winter. On average, Earthâ€™s temperature has been rising steadily since the Industrial Revolution. The hottest years in recorded history have occurred in the last decade. The oceans are becoming more acidic and their levels are rising, hurricanes and cyclones are becoming more powerful, the rain forest of the Amazon is drying, the boreal forest of North America is dying, multiple species of flora and fauna are going extinct, the great glacier above Greenland is thinning, and as previously mentioned, the Arctic ice cap is melting, all due to the rising temperatures.</p>

			<p>Once we pass a certain threshold, Earth will continue warming even if we do manage to cut our CO2 emissions. Many environmentalists think we have already passed this point of no return.</p>
