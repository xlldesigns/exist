			<h1>Biodiversity</h1>

			<p>Humans are responsible for the massive extinctions of countless species on Earth. Reports state that 10-30 percent of mammals, birds and amphibians on the planet are currently in danger of extinction due to human activity, which includes deforestation, CO2 emissions, over-exploitation, and invasive species introduction. This rapid extinction is therefore likely to precipitate collapses of ecosystems at a global scale resulting in large-scale agricultural problems and threatening food supplies to hundreds of millions of people.</p>

			<p>In any ecosystem, when one species dies, it affects other species, which depended on the now-extinct species for food and perhaps other necessities. When there is a sudden mass extinction of many species, a chain reaction can cause catastrophic results. For example, with the current destruction of marine ecosystems and exposing organisms to intolerable evolutionary pressure, humankind may be issuing in a mass extinction that will start from the ocean and move its way on up the food chain to land dwellers.</p>

			<p>Another example of the effects of species extinction can be observed from Bees. Bees are dying - an alarming amount. Already, as many as 50% of the hives in the U.S. and Europe have collapsed in the past 10 years. The suspect in bee deaths is a class of chemicals called neonicotinoids, pesticides used on a massive scale in commercial farming. It is believed the chemicals impair the beesâ€™ sense of direction, preventing them from returning to the hive. With reduced pollen in the hive, fewer queen bees are produced, and eventually the colonies collapse. Bees pollinate up to 1/3 of the world's food supply. No bees = 1/3 less food in the world.</p>
